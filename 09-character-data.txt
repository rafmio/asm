When you have arrays of values, you need to know where the endpoint is.
The common way to mark the ending of the string is with the NULL character. The null character has a literal value of 0 in ASCII, and it specifically meands "the and of the string". 

If you string is a null-terminated string (has a null character at the end), then all you need to know is ahte addres of the first character.
