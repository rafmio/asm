There are basically four types of jump instruction:
	- short
	- near
	- far
	- indirect

Short jump - withn 127 bytes of the current instruction.
Near - somewhere within the current address space. 
Far - isn't really used anymore.
Indirect - allow us to jump to an address that we won't know until runtime:
		jmp  mytarget
		jmp *mytarget
