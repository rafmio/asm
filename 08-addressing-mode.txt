The general syntax for accessing memory is:

VALUE(BASEREG, IDXREG, MULTIPLIER)

VALUE - fixed value
BASEREG and IDXREG - registers
MULTIPLIER - fixed multiplier, which can be 1, 2, 4 or 8 (it is 1 if left out)

If piece is left out, it is assumed to be zero (except for MULTIPLIER, which is assumed to be one)
